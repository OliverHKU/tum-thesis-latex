Eating is a highly emotional behavior which can be affected by stress, and the eating patterns under stress are different among individuals. In this thesis, methods were proposed to predict individuals' eating behaviors based on their stress levels. A chatbot was developed to detect stress based on historical data, process conversations with its users, and record eating behavior data. After user studies, several predictive models were trained for selected candidates using machine learning methods. The best-performing models were selected to generate stress-eating reports evaluated by the candidates. It was proven that this method was able to predict individuals' eating behavior based on conversational data, despite the relatively small data size.
