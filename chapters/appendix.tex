\chapter{Complete Collection of Statements Describing the Candidates' Eating Behaviors}\label{collect-statement}
A complete collection of statements used to describe the participants' eating behaviors are listed here. The numbers in the statements can vary among participants.
\begin{itemize}
  \item It appears that you are likely to eat more than usual when you're stressed.
  \item It appears that you are likely to eat less than usual when you're stressed.
  \item It appears that stress does not affect the amount of food you eat.
  \item On average, you eat 6 pieces per day when you're not stressed.
  \item Low levels of stress do not seem to affect the number of pieces.
  \item High levels of stress do not seem to affect the number of pieces.
  \item However, when you experience high levels of stress, you are likely to eat more pieces.
  \item However, when you experience relatively low levels of stress, you are likely to eat more pieces.
  \item Most of the time, you eat comfort food when you're stressed.
  \item Most of the time, you do not eat comfort food when you're stressed.
\end{itemize}
