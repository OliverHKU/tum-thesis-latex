\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
Eating is an activity that people perform on a daily basis. It is the essential source of ingredients for us humans. Our nutrition intake, in turn, affects our health. However, people’s choice of food cannot be simply regulated in terms of time and ingredients to make the best health effect out of it, because it is a highly emotional behavior (\cite{4_mood_eat}). According to \citeauthor{4_mood_eat}, both positive and negative moods affect food choices. Especially, having negative moods often leads one to pick indulgent food instead of healthy food to cope with the emotion.

Stress is a common reaction to the environment that is often linked to negative emotions. In fact, \citeauthor{1_stress_emotion} (\citeyear{1_stress_emotion}) suggests that there is a significant positive correlation between the level of stress one has and the degree of negative emotions one experiences. Combining the results from both studies, it is therefore highly likely that food choices could be affected by stress.

A study by \citeauthor{2_many_stress} (\citeyear{2_many_stress}) suggests that a majority of the population in the United Kingdom may have been overwhelmed with stress at some time within the year 2018. This suggests that many of the health problems resulted from unhealthy eating behaviors could be linked to stress. However, regulating eating behavior often requires a deep understanding of nutrition and diet, which is not the possession of non-experts. There are professionals who are out there to offer counseling services on people’s diet, but this is understandably not always accessible by the general public, given the pervasiveness of stress among them. Moreover, the specific eating behavior resulted from stress differs among individuals (\cite{5_stress_eating}). For example, the same level of stress can lead to overeating for one person, but undereating for another. It is, therefore, crucial to work out an individual’s eating behavior under the influence of stress without professional medical intervention.
